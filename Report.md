## Introduction

Each year about 3.2 million students graduate from high school, of which 2 million continue their education going to college [1]. Shortlisting universities is often a cumbersome process which is limited by individual bias and timing constraints. Students need to consider various factors, including but not limited to university ranking, location, tuition cost, financial aid, campus life and safety. Evaluating the importance of these different factors to select a university could be tricky.

Furthermore, most students attend college in order to get a better job with a higher salary. But the financial returns to college vary widely depending on the institution a student attends and the subject they study. While prospective students often ask themselves whether college is worth it, the more important questions are how they can make college worth it and what factors affect the return on their investment.
