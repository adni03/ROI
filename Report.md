## Introduction

Each year about 3.2 million students graduate from high school, of which 2 million continue their education going to college [1]. Shortlisting universities is often a cumbersome process which is limited by individual bias and timing constraints. Students need to consider various factors, including but not limited to university ranking, location, tuition cost, financial aid, campus life and safety. Evaluating the importance of these different factors to select a university could be tricky.

According to NCES, there are 3,982 institutions in the United States, out of which 1,625 are public four-year and two-year colleges; 1,660 private non-profit four-year and two-year schools; and 657 for-profit schools [2]. The sheer volume of the colleges makes it impossible to review the academic and financial requirements, and the culture to find a university that best suits a student. A college shortlist is a list of approximately six to ten colleges that helps a student to streamline their application process. Creating a college shortlist helps them organize a list of potential schools, encourages them to narrow down their choices, and prompts them to identify schools to further communicate with.

Most students attend college in order to get a better job with a higher salary. But the financial returns to college vary widely depending on the institution a student attends and the subject they study. While prospective students often ask themselves whether college is worth it, the more important questions are how they can make college worth it and what factors affect the return on their investment. A student’s return on investment is based on the time it takes to recoup their original financial investment toward tuition by earning a salary post-graduation. Factors that influence this return on investment are not set in stone and require analysis to identify. These factors influence the university shortlists, making the whole process much more arduous. 

Our application provides students with a dashboard that helps personalize their college shortlists based on their profile, by recommending a list of schools “best fit” for them. This recommendation is based on their preferences for region, funding type, tuition range and academic scores. We also produce a dashboard that details the academic and financial summaries for a university of their choice and display various visualizations describing the demographics of that school. Lastly, we enable the student to dig deeper into the factors they should consider to maximize the return on their investment by illustrating the influence features like tuition cost have on their post-graduation income. Through the analysis in our application, we provide answers to the following questions:
* What universities are best fit for me?
* What university-level characteristics influence my ROI?
